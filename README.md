> ✉️ 💌 ✉️ imap query client that speaks json

## 👩‍🏭 development

This is a [rustlang](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) application.
Go grab yourself a copy with [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

## 🤸 usage

The default imap domain is Google's. 

It is recommended to pass in your [Mail app password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en) from stdin.

```sh
echo -n "apppassword" | cargo run -p mailbox-cli -- -u "you@gmail.com" subject:lotto since:1-jan-2019
```

### query filters

Query filters expected in the form of `{name}:{value}` arguments. Multi work values should be quoted.

Some example imap search filters are as follows

```
BCC "string" - match messages with "string" in the Bcc: field
BEFORE "date" - match messages with Date: before "date"
BODY "string" - match messages with "string" in the body of the message
CC "string" - match messages with "string" in the Cc: field
FROM "string" - match messages with "string" in the From: field
KEYWORD "string" - match messages with "string" as a keyword
ON "date" - match messages with Date: matching "date"
SINCE "date" - match messages with Date: after "date"
SUBJECT "string" - match messages with "string" in the Subject:
TEXT "string" - match messages with text "string"
TO "string" - match messages with "string" in the To:
UNKEYWORD "string" - match messages that do not have the keyword "string"
```

### template output

You can optional template the array of json messages with a handlebars template.

```sh
echo -n "apppassword" | cargo run -p mailbox-cli -- -u "you@gmail.com" subject:lotto since:1-jan-2019 -t '{{#each .}}{{subject}}
{{/each}}
```
